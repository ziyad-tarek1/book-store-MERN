# A sample e-commerce web app built with ReactJS, ExpressJS and MongoDB

MERN stack which stands for MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS and NodeJS has become a popular choice for fullstack Javascript web developer.

As a personal project for education purpose, I developed a basic bookstore web app with MERN stack.

Through this project, beginners could have a useful resource to understand how to implement ReactJS, Redux, React Router and others related libraries in React ecosystem to build up a functional front-end solution.

In addition, the back-end developed with ExpressJS and MongoDB is also an example for building a web api with Javascript.
